About:
C-DAC ATC Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is the premier R&D organization of the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY), Ministry of Communications & Information Technology (MCIT) for carrying out R&D in IT, Electronics and associated areas.

Foundation:
Founded by its parent company cdac pune, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, of the Government of India in 1988.

History:
After being denied a Cray supercomputer by the United States in 1987, due to military use concerns, India started a programme to develop an indigenous supercomputer in collaboration with Russia. Supercomputers were considered a double-edged weapon capable of assisting in the development of nuclear weapons. For the purpose of achieving self-sufficiency in the field, C-DAC was established by the Department of Electronics in 1988. Dr Vijay Bhatkar was hired as the Director of C-DAC. The project was given an initial run of 3 years and an initial funding of â‚¹30,00,00,000 as the same amount of money and time was usually expended to secure the purchase of a supercomputer from the US. In 1990, a prototype was produced and was benchmarked at the 1990 Zurich Supercomputering Show (CONPAR 1990?). It surpassed most other systems, placing second after US.

The final result of the effort was the PARAM 8000, which was installed in 1991. It is considered to be India's first supercomputer.
